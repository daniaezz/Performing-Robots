# Eight Lessons Learned about Non-verbal Interactions through Robot Theater

Non-verbal communication is one of the most fundamental components of human interaction and incorporating it in the different ways mentioned in the reading will result in more natural human-robot interaction and even human-human or robot-robot interaction. 


One of the things that stood out to me in this reading was lesson 2 - *There Is No Mind without Body*. This section made me wonder if a body is necessary for a robot to be fully expressive? While I do think that having a body and utilizing it correctly will give the robot a whole other dimension of expressiveness, I believe that an (almost) equal level of expressiveness could be reached even by virtual agents that do not have a physical body if they were to utilize the tools available to them, like sound, correctly to make them appear more expressive. 


Another (sort of abstract) thought that I had while doing the reading was how do we differentiate between different emotions that use the same non-verbal interactions? How can we successfully convey the goal or intention without having the audience misinterpret the intention? Using the one of the “look, reach, grab” behaviours as an example, how do we properly convey that the extended “look” phase means that the robot is unsure of how to pick up the object rather than the robot being too lazy to pick the object?
