The first thing that caught my attention in this reading was Vaucanson’s gilded copper
Duck, which exposed some of the mechanisms of biology like digestion. In this case “the mechanical was a window into the organic”. This made me think of how by building robots that have emotions or appear human, we learn more about how humans work and where these emotions stem from or what makes us human in the first place. I was really fascinated by the idea of robots helping us understand ourselves more, especially since I have never thought of it in that way. 

Another idea that I thought was interesting was how robots are a way for us to understand the universe around us in a way that is more approachable to us and that would help us understand the world more. 

One thing that I disagreed with was what Vernprala said about Baxter, “It comes down to us forcing it to be human. But there is no natural human aspect to Baxter.” I disagree and I think that there is some sort of human aspect to baxter. While his physical body may not be made of flesh, his limbs and his movement imitate the idea of a human arm, his face was also inspired by humans. I also think that it's our own interpretation of him that gives him this aspect of humanity. While he himself technically may not have any human aspects, our way of understanding baxter, by projecting what we know onto him, gives him some aspect of humanity
