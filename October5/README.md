# The Freudian Robot
---
The author defines the Freudian Robot as “any networked being that embodies the feedback loop of human-machine simulacra and cannot free her/him/itself from the cybernetic unconscious”. This definition is vague and leaves a lot to the imagination. Can this definition apply to humans, animals and other living organisms? So what is the difference between a human and a freudian robot? 

One thing that I found deeply emphasized in the reading was the philosophy of whether these robots were instruments that simply provide assistance to us or humans were slaves to these machines. “He who does his work in the manner of a machine lets his mind run like a machine” I found this line from the parable particularly interesting because we are so dependent on machines for our daily lives, and from a certain perspective, it may appear that we are programmed to do certain activities, just like a machine. This also reminds me of last week’s reading where the question of whether or not humans become robotic the more robots become more human. The idea of the freudian robot blurred the line between machines and humans even further. 

This also brings me back to one of the questions mentioned earlier in this book: Why do we create robots and machines that resemble human beings? This question has been on my mind since the beginning of the semester and yet I still can not find a definite answer for it.
