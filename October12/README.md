# Robot Documentation

Making the robot move using a remote control took much longer than I anticipated. Most of the time, I was confused which side was the front side of the robot and which side was the back. While moving the robot around the arts centre, we noticed that one of the wooden pieces we added to stabilize the robot caused it to stop when the floor got uneven. To fix this problem, we tried sanding down the piece of wood but with no avail. We ended up replacing it with a smaller piece which ended up causing our robot to stagger a bit when stopping, but still stay stable enough.
