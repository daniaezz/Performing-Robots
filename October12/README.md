# Robot Documentation

Making the robot move using a remote control took much longer than I anticipated. Most of the time, I was confused which side was the front side of the robot and which side was the back. While moving the robot around the arts centre, we noticed that one of the wooden pieces we added to stabilize the robot caused it to stop when the floor got uneven. To fix this problem, we tried sanding down the piece of wood but with no avail. We ended up replacing it with a smaller piece which ended up causing our robot to stagger a bit when stopping, but still stay stable enough.

# Thinking Something Makes it So

“‘[y]our android. How much of it is you?” This question intrigued me because throughout the reading, it was emphasised that the robot.. is a replica of human Ikunmi, this paragraph however, suggests that human ikumi and android ikumi have different character traits the more android ikumi experiences things. Because android ikumi experiences things forever as it can not die, this makes me wonder when android ikumi will stop being a replica of human ikumi and become its own “person”, with its own experiences, when does it become “human” if it can ever reach that stage?
