# Towards a Dramaturgy of Robots and Object-Figures
Throughout the semester, I always wondered why people invest so heavily in research to make a robot look and act exactly like a human would. It didn't make sense to me to create something that would play the role of a human exactly like how a human would. But through this reading, I think i strarted to understand the need for this type of research. Through GOSSIP i felt like the performance was briefly treading into the uncanny valley by having people of the all the same height, people that feel like they are different on the surface level but on a closer look are all the same, giving the performance an eerie effect on the viewer which might not be achievable by people because they naturally do not fall into the uncanny valley.
